## Major Features:

1. **Sign Language to Text and Speech**: Transform sign language gestures into text and spoken words.
2. **Speech to Sign Language**: Communicate with sign language by inputting speech.
3. **Youtube Transcript Conversion**: Display Youtube video transcripts in sign language to aid the specially-abled.

## Abstract

Breaking communication barriers, we employ neural networks to recognize finger-spelling based American Sign Language in real-time. Our convolutional neural network (CNN) method dives into the intriguing realm of human hand gesture recognition from camera images. By filtering and classifying hand gestures, our system predicts and interprets sign language, fostering inclusivity.

## Introduction

In a world where spoken language isn't an option for communication-related disabilities, American Sign Language takes center stage. This non-verbal form of communication involves hand gestures and visual expressions. Our project focuses on recognizing finger-spelling-based hand gestures, bridging the communication gap for the deaf and mute.

## Scope

Beneficial for both the deaf/mute and those unfamiliar with sign language, this system interprets sign language gestures, providing output in both text and speech formats. Ease of communication is enhanced, allowing meaningful interactions between individuals regardless of sign language knowledge.

In addition, our system extends its capabilities to Youtube videos, providing an inclusive experience by converting captions into live sign language gestures. Future collaborations with Youtube and Google envision avatars translating captions into dynamic gestures.

## Data Acquisition

Using a vision-based approach, the computer's webcam becomes the input device, observing hand and finger movements. This method facilitates natural interaction, eliminating the need for extra devices. Challenges in handling various hand appearances due to movements, skin color variations, and different viewpoints are addressed.

## Gesture Classification

Leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology, our system excels in:

- Convolutional Layer
- Pooling Layer
- Fully Connected Layer

## Text To Speech Translation

This module translates text into speech using the pyttsx3 library. Users can input words using sign language, and the system converts them into spoken words.
